Spica, the brightest star in Virgo constellation, is actually a binary star system located 250 light-years from Earth. Its name derives from Latin meaning "ear of wheat," reflecting its association with harvest goddesses like Ishtar and Ceres. In Greek mythology, Spica represents the wheat sheaf held by Virgo, the maiden, often identified as Persephone or Demeter.

Astrologically, Spica is considered highly fortunate, associated with artistic talent, scientific achievement, and spiritual wisdom. Ancient astrologers viewed it as bringing success, renown, and wealth. The star's position marked important seasonal changes in many ancient cultures, particularly for agricultural timing.

Known for its pure white-blue brilliance, Spica has been used for celestial navigation throughout history.
