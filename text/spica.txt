The binary-star Spica, foremost luminary of the constellation Virgo, stood behind our sun at my moment of birth. 

Visible to the human eye, Spica's emergence coincided with the harvest season, variously known as the grape-gatherer, the sheaf of wheat held by Persephone, or simply: the bright one.

Here, SPICA is a thread of songs that I have stitched together:

<br>Little Sunflower, Freddie Hubbard</br>
<br>Sometimes I Cry, Les McCann</br>
One Dance, Don Cherry feat. Latif Khan 
Raga Bhairavi, Shivkumar Sharma
