The binary-star Spica, foremost luminary of the constellation Virgo, stood behind our sun at my moment of birth. 

Visible to the human eye, Spica's emergence coincided with the harvest season, variously known as the grape-gatherer, the sheaf of wheat held by Persephone, or simply: the bright one.

Here, SPICA is a thread of songs that I have stitched together:

1 Little Sunflower, Freddie Hubbard
2 Sometimes I Cry, Les McCann
3 One Dance, Don Cherry and Latif Khan 
4 Raga Bhairavi, Shivkumar Sharma
5 Greetings to Saud, Pharoah Sanders
6 Raga Madhyamad Sarang, Kishori Amonkar
7 Bismillahi 'Rrahmani 'Rrahim, Harold Budd
8 Kunchh Dil Na Kaha, Lata Mangeshkar




1 Is This All, Bobby Humpfrey
2 L'Ille Neue, Hikaru Hayashi (The Naked Island OST) 1960
3 You'll Know When You Get There, Herbie Hancock, Mwandishi 
4 Tohobohu Part II, Marc Moulin, Sam Suffy
5 Twin Stars of Thence, Sun Ra Arkestra
